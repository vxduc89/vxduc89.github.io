            <h1>CONVOY TRANSITION BACKPACK</h1>
        <p>     DESCRIPTION:<br>
            The Convoy Transition Backpack is the Triathlon Bag that we wished for when we were cussing out slow zippers and wrong-sized compartments crammed with gear at transition. Designed to make life easier and more organized for triathletes, the LTRX showcases a 30" x 15" x 15" design and metal frame construction for rugged durability. A front stretch mesh helmet compartment can accommodate all helmet types and super-strong nylon construction is designed to last. Padding throughout the lower back, mid back, shoulders and obliques helps to distribute weight, while padded waist buckles provide accessible storage.<br>
            Because races are won by seconds, the Convoy Transition Bag opens like a tool box so you don't have to spend time digging. Three internal mesh dividers separate swim, bike and run gear, and multiple internal pockets allow for custom gear configurations. A removable wetsuit bag keeps your gear dry, while two external water bottle pockets and zippered compartments keep nutrition and hydration at your finger tips.<br>
            Dimensions: 30"H x 15"W x 15"D (75 Liters)<br>
