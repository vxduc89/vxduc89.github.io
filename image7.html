            <h1>TYR MEN'S CARBON TRI TANK</h1>
        <p>     DESCRIPTION:<br>
            TYR Carbon is a game-changing fabric that fuels performance across the disciplines. Constructed from this breakthrough fabric, the TYR Men's Carbon Tri Tank helps lower your body temperature and heart rate and results in more efficient breathing and less lactic acid buildup.<br>
            The TKMBZ6A tri tank is made with smooth bonded seams to maximize strength and comfort while minimizing drag. Additionally, this men's triathlon top has carbon flash mesh, which is uniquely engineered to draw moisture away from the body, keeping you feeling light and dry throughout the race.<br>
            TYR tri tops are more than apparel. They're equipment. All triathlon tanks feature compression, anti-chafe and UPF 50+.
