            <h1>MEN'S HURRICANE WETSUIT CAT 5</h1>
        <p>     DESCRIPTION:<br>
            At TYR Sport we believe that having the best wetsuit begins with having the best fabrication. As a result, every Cat 5 Hurricane is constructed with 100% 39 Cell Yamamoto neoprene. In addition, the process of Super Composite Skin (SCS) Nano Coating is used alongside the fabrication to enhance comfort and freedom of movement. With both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties, SCS repels water, ensures high heat retention for decreased body fatigue and boasts incredible durability to prevent abrasions and increase product life. Rather than a standard seam construction, each Cat 5 also utilizes speed wrap paneling to comfortably hug and hold you in.<br>
            Next, strategically placed elevation panels are employed to establish proper body positioning relative to the waterâ€™s surface, while graded catch panels on the forearms of the suit provide a catch-and-pull stroke similar to having a built-in paddle. When working in conjunction with form-fitting wrist cuffs, the result is maximized power strokes without any water intake.<br>
            Each and every HCCVM6A wetsuit also includes quick release ankle cuffs, an innovative antimicrobial lining and state-of-the-art range of motion zones.
